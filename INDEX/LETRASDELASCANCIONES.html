    <I align="left">Ooh
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
<br>
<br>
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
<br>
<br>
Ooh
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
<br>
<br>
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
<br>
<br>
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
<br>
<br>
Oh-oh, oh
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
I'd wanna be next to you.</I></li>

Abracadabra, abracadabra
<BR>
<BR>
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawin' circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
<BR>
<BR>
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
<BR>
<BR>
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a hauntin' dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night
<BR>
<BR>
Abracadabra, amor, ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta, ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra, ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said
Death or love tonight
<BR>
<BR>
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra
<BR>
Choose the road on the west side
As the dust flies, watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feelin'
Use your passion, no return
<BR>
<BR>
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
<BR>
<BR>
Like a poem said by a lady in red

Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra
<BR>
<BR>
Phantom of the dance floor, come to me
Sing for me a sinful melody
<BR>
<BR>
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
<BR>

<br>
<I align="left">I want you to stay
Till I'm in the grave
Till I rot away, dead and buried
Till I'm in the casket you carry
<br>
<br>
If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, alright
And if I'm turning blue, please, don't save me
Nothing left to lose without my baby
<br>
<br>
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
<br>
<br>
And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I
<br>
<br>
I'll love you till the day that I die
Till the day that I die
Till the light leaves my eyes
Till the day that I die
<br>
<br>
I want you to see, mmm
How you look to me, huh
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
<br>
<br>
But you're so full of shit, hmm
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
<br>
<br>
And I don't know what I'm crying for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but, baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
<br>
<br>
(Birds of a feather, we should stick together) till the day that I die
(I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone) till the light leaves my eyes
(Can't change the weather, might not be forever) till the day that I die
But if it's forever, it's even better.
<br>
<br>
I knew you in another life
You had the same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised.</I></li>

Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
